SID,Item_1,Item_21,"An antibiotic enters a microbial population and kills all the bacteria that is susceptable to it. This leaves very little bacteria, but that bacteria has mutations that allow it to survive. This little bit of bacteria then has all the room and nutrients left by the other bacteria. It then multiplies within the body and this keeps happening until its the main bacteria because antibiotics have gotten rid of the rest so it can take over and make you sick and nothing can kill it.","Antibiotic resistance is a natural protective mechanism microbial populations use to fight antibiotics. Advantageous mutations occur and are selected for by antibiotics. Then the bacteria w/out those mutations are killed, leaving only those not susceptable to antibiotics with more space and resources."4,"Microbial resistance to antibiotic can be present due to mutation or evolution. In some cases resistance can be caused by chance, thus resulting in a population growth containing the mutation due to the survival rate. In other cases, evolution can cause resistance by ""over usage"" of the antibiotic. If the bacteria is continuously exposed to an antibiotic, the ability to evolve/adapt are greatly higher and resistant is most likely to occurr!","Microbial populations develop antibiotic resistance through multiple ways! Some resistance can evolve through chance, or in order words mutation. Since mutations are random, ""they"" arise anytime and anywhere, but the key is if the mutation is beneficial for the microbe. If the mutation is benefitial, than the microb will reproduce and spread the mutated genes, thus resistance grows/evolves within the population. Also mutated genes can be exchanged within members of the population through plasmids. By exchanging genes, the population can also reproduce + spread the mutated genes."5,"When a microbial population encounters an antibiotic the microbial will most likely die. However when the microbial population is exposed to an antibiotic, but that micro was not the strongest it will pass down its genetic information to its offspring. As time goes on the microbials will grow stronger until the antibiotics can no longer kill the microbial population. ",Microbial populations evolves resistance to antibiotics by mutations. After the microbial population is exposed to antibiotics for a period of time some species of the population will mutate to have a stronger resistance. When this resistance occurs the DNA from the resistant microbial will be passed on causing the population to continue to grow.6,"By the bacteria being affected by the antibiotic to eliminate itself. It may be hard to fight the bacteria off, if it is a large amount present.","A microbial population evolves resistance to the effects of an antibiotic by the spreading of the bacteria, and the cells multiplying through binary fission. Through mutation, the antibiotic binds to a protein so the protein can't function properly, which is evolved in copying the DNA, this would cause more bacteria growth possibly causing resistance."7,"Random mutations occur in the genes of bacteria to help them evolve. When a population of bacteria is exposed to an antibiotic, most of them might die, but any with a chance mutation to help resist the antibiotic will survive. These survivors will then pass on their resistant genes. Then the antibiotic resistant bacteria population grows.","In a microbial population, mutations happen by chance. So when exposed to antibiotics, the microbials that happen to have a mutation that gives them resistance will survive while the others are killed. These surviving bacteria will reproduce which means that their offspring will likely have the same mutation to be resistant. This resistant population will grow over time. In short, the bacteria mutate at random, the environment selects for mutations that increase fitness."8,An antibiotic is introduced to a population of bacteria. It kills the majority (ideally) but some bacteria survive due to a natural resistance to the antibiotic. Those survivors then replicate into another large population and this time they are all resistant to the antibiotic.,"An individual in the population could have slight resistance to an antibiotic. After an antibiotic is introduced into the population only that organism could survive, likely in a weakened state. They then ""replenish"" the population, which now all have the slight resistance. Through a random mutation, the slight resistance could become full blown resistance. So if there's an individual with complete resistance, the same process could lead to a resistant population."9,"During DNA replication, a mutation could arise that would allow the microbe to resist the antibiotic and survive. While the antibiotic kills off much of the microbial population, those w/a mutation that helps them survive will continue to replicate + pass on that mutation until the population develops resistance.","Antibiotics kill off most of a microbial population; however, some individuals can randomly develop a mutation that combats the effects of the antibiotic. These individuals survive and proliferate, spreading their mutation for antibiotic resistance to other members of the population. Once all the bacteria have this mutation, the antibiotic is essentially worthless and antibiotic resistance has emerged."11,"In the large microbial population, some (very few) have mutated genes (rare occurance) which allow them to resist antibiotics. When antibiotics are introduced, these mutated microbes are the only ones abl eto survive, so they live on and produce more microbes which also carry the gene/s for antibiotic resistance.","Wild population has antibiotic introduced: Antibiotic kills almost all the population. Some have random mutation that lets them survive antibiotic. Surviving microbes start new population, with every member inheriting the mutation that resists the antibiotic. Mutant population is now resistant to the antibiotic."12,As antibiotic are used to kill off bacteria that bacteria experiences mutations that makes the bacteria resistant to the antibiotics. The more the antibiotic is used the more resistant it will become.,"Through mutation  &gene exchange. This mutated organism will survive & reproduce where the non mutated organism will die leaving the population with only resistant organisms in the population. The more you use antibiotic, the stronger the population becomes resistant."13,"It is the same theory in which Darwin built himself/his reputation on, only the strong survive. With animals it was the ones that could adapt to their environment lived and then grew back up. It is the same thing in a microbial population, over time within their makeup they become unaffected by an antibiotic rebuild (?) + the cycle begins again.",A microbial population evolves a resnstance to an antibiotic through the idea or survival of the fittest. Each organism in a population possesses a different genetic make up w/different mutations throughout their DNA sequence. W/these mutations in place certain organisms are resistant to antibiotics & over time these become the dominant species within the microbial population.14,"There is a random mutation that will occur, where it will give the microbe an ""advantage"" thus allowing it to survive antibiotic exposure. The more frequent the antibiotic exposure, the more of the resistant microbes (ones w. mutation- gained from fast reproduction) will be present, eventually leading to entire population of resistant microbes.","At the initial exposure to antibiotics, if there is a bacterium that has a mutation occur at random, but is able to survive the exposure, they will be able to reproduce. The more that the bacteria are exposed to antibiotics, the more likely these resistant mutations are to be amplified and favored. Therefore, their fitness is higher than the population that doesn't have this mutation and they're able to reproduce and pass on this mutation until all of the bacteria in a population have the gene and are antibiotic resistant."15,"Mutation occurs in some members of the population, this mutation allows them to survive when antibiotics are present. The weak bacteria will be killed off and the surviving bacteria will pass along this immunity to their offspring.","The antibiotic, when exposed to a microbial population will eliminate or inhibit the growth of vulnerable bacteria. Some of the members of this population will have immunity to the antibiotic. These organisms will be free to grow and replicate. Eventually this population will consist of individuals that are immune to the antibiotic."16,"In a microbial population such as bacteria, a resistance is first gained by a mutation in DNA sequence that allows bacteria to become resistant. Once antibiotics are introduced all bacteria w/o mutation die leaving only resistant bacteria to live & replicate and make more antibiotic resistant bacteria.","A microbial population evolves resistance effects in several ways. A resistant trait must first be created by a mutation of an existing gene. Then bacteria can share this trait by sharing plasmids, mitosis, and picking up bits of DNA from the environment. Human influence also plays a role. When humans use antibiotics to kill bacteria they kill everything that is not resistant. Then the resistant bacteria can reproduce and grow the population because they have all the resources and no competition."17,They are exposed to the antibiotic + some of the bacteria become resistant and then those resistant bacteria replicate to create even more resistant bacteria. Bacteria replicates at a very fast rate in the process of binary fission + eventually a couple of resistant bacteria create a large amount of resistant bacteria to the antibiotic.,"A microbial population evolves resistance to an antibiotic by first being exposed to that antibiotic. Once exposed, mutations occur in the population that develop resistance. These mutations continue to occur by the resistant population reproducing. Bacteria reproduce rapidly by binary fission and once one mutation (mutation that results in resistance) occurs, it continues to occur + eventually an entire population can become resistant."18,"More resistant genes can be selected for by improper use of antibiotics; (i.e. not killing off all the bacteria) the ones left are allowed to continue to multiply. This can result (through mutations) in more & more resistant genes to occur. Bacteria can also ""give"" these resistant trait to others around it when each bacterias DNA comes in contact (kind of like crossing over)",The application/pressence of the anti-biotic kills most of the microbs (largely dependent upon their genes) the remaining microbs then begin reproducing creating a population that has the genes that allowed them to survive; this process can be repeated & with each replication there is a chance that a mutation could occure increasing the microbs resistance. So it all boils down to DNA & genes.19,"When a population of bacteria is exposed to antibiotic, it will kill a majority and most of the bacteria. However the bacteria that survives can eventually develop a resistance to the antibiotic and reproduce, creating a new bacteria population that is resistant to the antibiotic.","A population develops resistance to an antibiotic when it is applied. When applied, it kills a majority of the bacterial cells, with some still surviving.These that survive then replicate and create bacteria that is also resistant. Over multiple generations, the populations ends up being resistant to the antibiotic."20,"When the antibiotic is introduced to the population the organisms that cannot survive the effects of the antibiotic will die, these bacteria that have somehow mutated to survive the effects will live on to replicate. Initially this resistant population will be very small, but over time as more of the antibiotic is used this resistant population will increase in number until it is the dominant type of bacteria present in the population.","A microbial population evolves resistance to the effects of an antibiotic through random mutations which can lead to better fitness. Some mutations may lead to a resistance to the antibiotic so bacteria with these mutations will survive longer than those without this mutation, over time these surviving bacteria will overtake the non resistant population giving the population as a whole resistance to the antibiotic."21,"Over time mutations form in the DNA of the microbial that allow it to survive the presence of antibiotics, thus allowing it to pass on the mutation once it reproduces.","The only way for resistance to initially appear is due to a mutation in a bacteria cell in the genes. These occurrances are random, cannot be predicted. Once the mutation appears, the resistant cell has a better chance of surviving, generally, and passes on the resistance gene to its offspring through mitosis. As the resistant cells in a population keeps surviving and passing on the resistance. The number of resistant bacterium continues to grow."22,In a microbial population some microbes get different doses of the antibiotic. Those with a large dose die off and those with a lower dose endure and survive long enough to replicate. As those microbes replicate over time they become more resistant to the bacteria where they can become totally resistant to the antibiotic.,"Microbial populations evolve resistance to effects of antibiotics by the process of the strongest will survive. This means when an antibiotic is introduced most of the population will perish, yet the strongest will survive and reproduce and their offspring will contain resistance genes and they will then reproduce and their offspring will have a stronger resistance to that particular antibiotic. They also evolve mechanisms to expel or not allow them to enter the cell wall."23,Repeated exposure kills off bacteria in the popultaion that are not resistant. A small fraction of the pop[ulation] already has a mutation allowing for resistance to the antibiotic. It is that fraction that sruvives after exposure to the antibiotic. The # of bacteria with that resistant gene then increase as bacteria multiply & generations play out- increasing the # of resistant bacteria.,"Mutated genes that can lead to resistant bacterial phenotypes must initially be present in the population. If that phenotype gives bacteria a competitive advantage (presence of reward for doing function that mutation allows for, or that strain w/resistance genes is not killed off during an application of antibiotics). If more individuals of other phenotypes die as a result of environmental pressure there will be reduced competition for resources w/the resistant bacteria and that population will proliferate & expand its range."24,If there is a survivor in a group of bacteria it can start to build resistance and more and more resistance can come in future generations from evolution to increase survival rate against antibacteria.,Resistance to antibiotics comes from evolution in the population from mutations that go on in the population. The mutations can occur randomly at any time and cause a resistance trait. Resistance can also evolve from exposure to the antibiotic leading to a selection pressure to push the population to evolve traits that fight off the antibiotic.25,"Random mutations occur during cell replication in the microbial population. When an antibiotic is used, it kills most of the bacteria except those mutations that are resistant to it. Evolution occurs as that resistant bacteria is selected for and the bacteria that is not resistant to the antibiotic dies. Thus, creating a new microbial population that is resistant to that certain antibiotic.","A microbial population evolves resistance to the effects of an antibiotic as a result of a random mutation. This mutation that is resistant to the antibiotic survives over the non-resistent population, causing its genes to get passed down through generations, causing the microbial population to gain an overall resistance to the antibiotic throughout generations."27,"When microbes reproduce, mutations can occur in populations. Sometimes those mutations are benificial to the microbes and in the case of introducing antibiotics, the mutation might help the microbe to survive from that. When that happens, the resistant bacteria population evolves to being a totally antibiotic resistant population of microbes because the microbes w/o that benificial mutation die off, and the other microbes become more ""fit."" ","Microbial populations evolve to be antibiotic resistance when they reproduce and mutations randomly occur in a population. That mutation could cause that one microbe to survive in the presence of antibiotics. Then, that one bacteria reproduces and thrives even in the presence of an antibiotic, causing antibiotic resistance to occur."28,Random mutations occur within a population of microbes. Certain mutations can be favored in a given environment. As these microbes are now most fit they can survive and reproduce at a higher rate than unfit microbes therefore passing down the mutation.,"Microbes evolve resistance through mutation. The mutation causes the organisms to be more fit allowing them to live longer and reproduce more than their non-resistant or less resistant neighbors over time through conjugation, transduction and transformation. This passes the mutation down allowing for the next generation to have even more resistance than previous generations."29,"When the antibiotic is introduced, it kills all organisms in the population except for those with resistance. This resistance is often the result of a random mutation, but it keeps the bacteria alive. Soon, only antibiotic resistant bacteria live in the colony and as they replicate all the new bacteria inherit the antibiotic resistance.The population has evolved to survive the antibiotics.","All the ones that haven't randomly mutated a resistance are killed by the antibiotic leaving only resistant organisms to reproduce. This population has evolved a higher proportion of antibiotic resistance. Sometimes rather than randomly mutate the resistance, bacteria can take it from a neighboring cell in a variety of ways. Conjugation, transformation, transduction."30,"The antibiotic kills all bacteria that haven't developed a random mutation that enabled them to survive, and then those microbes reproduce in the presence of the antibiotic and all that is left is the resistant bacteria.","A mutation in a population occurs during its asexual reproduction and that makes it antibiotic resistant. That allele makes the individual bacterium more fit for the environment present. Thus the allele increases in frequency in the environment. The allele can also be passed onto other existing bacteria through transformation, transduction, or conjugation, by another bacterium with the resistance gene or through a bacteriophage."32,In a population there are bacteria with resistant genes. When an antibiotic is use in the susceptible bacteria are killed by the antibiotic. This leaves the resistant bacteria alive to reproduce.,Resistance to antibiotics evolves randomly in a bacteria's DNA due to a mutation. This bacteria cell is then considered resistant. This bacteria divides creating more resistant bacteria. When an antibiotic is introduced it kills the susceptible bacteria leaving only the resistant behind. In this way the population evolves resistance.33,"An antibiotic is used to kill off bacterial infections. However if the antibiotic fails to kill off all the bacteria, and a population is left remaining that population of bacteria will pass on their newly gained resistance to future generations. The future generations will then not be killed when the same antibiotic is used resulting in overall resistance.","As a microbial population is exposed to antibiotics, the weak populations die off, and some remain. These remaining microbes then reproduce passing on their genes which are resistant to the specific antibiotic causing eventual resistance of the entire microbial population as more reproduction occurs."34,A microbial population evolves resistance to the effects of antibiotic when a microbe has experienced a mutation causing it to have resistance to the antibiotic. When the antibiotic comes into contact with the microbial population all of the microbes without resistance die while the resistant microbes survive. These resistant microbes then reproduce & create a population that is resistant.,"A microbial population must have an individual with a mutation that causes antibiotic resistance in order to cause the population to eventually gain the resistance. The resistance can either be spread by the resistant individual passing the gene containing the resistance into the cytoplasm of nearby microbes. Otherwise, the population evolves by first having the antibiotic kill off all of the weak microbes that don't have any type of resistance and then the surviving resistant bacterium reproduce, creating a resistant population."35,"Microbial populations experience a very fast reproduction rate. When cells divide there is always a chance for random mutation. If this mutation makes the cell more able to resist the effects of an antibiotic, it survives to then replicate more. This creates colonies of microbials resistant to an antibiotic.",Mutations occur randomly in a population. Microbial populations reproduce exponentially. This allows for a lot of random mutation to be present in a population. Some of these mutations could potentially be beneficial to the microbial. It could be resistant to an antibiotic. Microbials are also able to transfer their ability to be resistant to antibiotics in the form of plasmids to other microbials in the population.36,Natural population--(reproduces w/mutations)--> New generation w/a few resistant alleles --(introduce antibiotics)--> susceptible bacteria --(dies) --> Surviving bacteria w/resistant alleles--(repopulates)--> fully resistant bacterial population--(treat w/antibiotics)--> Nothing happens,"Antibiotic resistance always originates from a random mutation in an individual. When this resistance mutation occurs, if the population is treated with an antibiotic, all of the susceptible bacteria lacking the mutation will be killed off. Now that a bunch of the population has been eradicated, the individual(s) with the resistance mutation will have space to replicate. This allows the resistance allele to be passed on to their offspring, resulting in the development of a resistant population."37,"The microbial has a specific DNA code. This DNA code can have easy random mutations take place which could alter even one nitrogenous base. These mutations occur randomly. If placed in an environment of antibiotics, the microbial will die off. But if a mutation randomly occurs which is resistant to the current antibiotic then the mutated microbial will not die. More so the only microbial alive will be that which mutated and will only be able to reproduce thus expanding the anti-biotic resistant microbial.",A microbial population will evolve resistance over time through mutation. Random mutation events will cause changes in phenotypes (genotype--> phenotype) which may cause changes in selectivity. This change in selectivity will promote resistant population and over time we will be left with the resistant microbials after antibiotic kills off the non resistant.                                   DNA-(random mutation)-> varied DNA -(Antibiotic)-> DNA resistant left over-(over time)-> only resistant DNA38,"Random mutations in a member of a population of microbes causes it to be resistant to antibiotics. Application of antibiotic to the population then acts as a selective pressure, killing non-resistant bacteria and allowing bacteria with ""resistant"" mutations to survive. These surviving members then reproduce, multiplying and eventually creating an entire population carrying that mutation- a resistant population.                                [Diagram: circle organisms, mutated organisms shaded in... --antibiotic applied--> cell death for unshaded organisms--> Division, shaded organism doubles--> population of shaded organisms labeled ""mutant population""","A random mutation in some individual causes it to be resistant to antibiotics. When antibiotic is applied, this acts as a selective pressure, killing the organisms that are not resistant. Those that are resistant grow and divide, forming a new, resistant population."39,"When bacteria is exposed to antibiotics it usually kills off the bacteria. However, sometimes bacteria survives. The bacteria surviving is from a mutation of the bacteria. A mutation makes some type of resistance and helps bacteria survive the antibiotic. When this happens, the living bacteria reproduce forming many resistant bacteria over time.","Evolving requires mutations to appear within populations. Avida-Ed is a prime example of showing mutations that occur in populations and can show you the exact location(s) a mutation occurred. When mutants are fit, the resistance to antibiotics can be passed on to offspring and if they keep reproducing, eventually the unfit will die off and the resistant bacteria will take over.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
