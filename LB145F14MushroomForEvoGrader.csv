SID,Item_1,Item_21,Initially this protection would be super helpful for these mushrooms. It'd protect them from getting eaten.  Then any tha tdidn't kill humans would be selected against because then they's be eaten. Then posonous mushroom books and blogs would be published rendering the toxin uncessary because humans avoid them no matter what. Thus mutated mushrooms could survive.,"The initial occurrence would be from a change or mutation in the DNA. This would cuase a change in RNA, proteins, protein function, and phenotype (no toxin). This would be advantagious to the mushroom because it isn't using energy to maintain because it isn't using energy to maintain the toxin and it's becoming increasingly frequent because humans still don't eat it because it's know as toxic"2,Perhaps the increase in frequency of number of individuals that no longer produce this toxin would be due to the mammal population avoiding and no longer attempting to eat the mushrooms (because of their noticable toxic after effects). The mushrooms would no longer need to produce the toxin because mammals no longer include these organisms in their diet because of the bad effects.,A biologist would explain this occurrence through mutation of individuasl that produce the toxin. If the toxin is not creating a selective advantage for the individuals then it does not incrase their fitness and perhaps the genes that code for this toxin would eventually be turned off.3,"Since the mushroom is known to be toxic, it probably has a bad taste or smell that repels mammals that may eat it. Even when the mushroom has lost its toxicity, it probably still has its repulsion properties.  Mammals will still ignore it due to this. The initial occurance of non-toxity may have occured through a mutation in the mushroom gene.","The initial occurrence that allowed for non-toxicity was caused by a mutation in the mushroom genome. The heritable trait was show in more moshrooms. Since mammals probably knoew not ot eat the fungus due to bad tast or odor that usually accompanies toxic organisms, the new genetic variety of mushroom flourished."4,"As organisms evolve, we keep what we need for survival, thus we lose and gain abilities/parts. For this mushroom population, if the toxin no longer increases their chance of survival, then they will lose the ability to produce the toxin.","To explain why some individuals quit producing the toxin is if resistance has occurred. Since the mushrooms produced/used this toxin for survivel; if other mammals have evolved resistance, then the toxin is no longer beneficial. In this case, the mutants would be themushrooms without the toxin and since the toxin is not benefical, it will not be expressed or passed on to the offspring."6,"Biologists could explain the way that people would be isolated from a particular area and there might still be some intoxicated with the chemical, even after the individuals that don't produce it are there.","Biologist would explain that the species of mushrooms were maybe sprayed with bad chemicals such as other crops, and maybe explain something about ? And how they work, maybe something was done about it, like replacing the genes of the other organisms to the mushrooms."7,The initial occurance would be by a chance mutation. The increase in frequency would be due to a higher reproductive rate of the non-toxic mushrooms. This higher rate could possibly be cause by mammals helping spread the mushroom's spores.,"There was a chance mutation that made it so the mushrooms did not make the toxin. Beacuase the frequency of the non-toxin producing mushrooms is increasing this must have increased orn ot affected the mushroom fitness. If the animals know the psecies is toxi, they still won't eat the mushrooms that are not toxic, so there is really nothing decreasing the fitness of those mutated mushrooms. They could possibly have increased fitness if not making the toxin saves them energy."8,"Mushrooms are a fungus that thrive around dead organisms.  These toxic mushrooms most likely happened througha  chance mutation, and are declining in the population because animals activity avoid them after learning they're toxic.","The toxic mushroom species would have mutated, producing non-toxic offspring. If the non-toxic mushroom were identical in appearance of the toxic mushrooms, mammals could have evolved to avoid the toxic mushroom. These mammals would never attempt to eat the mushrooms because they think its tocis so the mushrooms would be free to reproduce, increasing the population."9,"The intial occurrence of mushrooms that no longer produces the toxin could have come from a mutation or change in the DNA. The increase in frequency of this nontoxic population could be from the idea that the mammals already know to avoid these mushrooms since they were once toxic to them. This way, these new mushrooms would not have predator mammals.","A random mutation occurred that could have changed nucleotides resulting in change in amino acids that code for different proteins wehre the toxin is not longer produced. This non-toxic population could increase due to its relation to the toxic mushroom species - other organsims know to stay away from toxic musrhoom - stay away from untoxic, related mushroom."10,"The toxin may have been caused by a mutation or other factors. A mammal most likely ate the first toxic mushroom and began ill or died, letting other mammals know that those mushrooms are not edible. Since those mushrooms would stop being consumed, after a few generations there would no longer be a need for the toxins since the mammal consumption would no longer be a threat, therefore letting the gene for toxicity to fade out.","Biologists may argue that the mammals who had previously consumed the toxic mushrooms had learned to associate that mushrooms had learned to associate that mushroom species as inedible. Therefore, as less and less of the mushroom species are being consumed; the  need for a defense system against mammalian predators will ahve decreased, leading to a decrease in the number of individuals who actually produce the toxin, as they are being outcompeted by those who do not produce the toxin."11,"The toxic chemical was initially a random mutation. This mutation prevented mammals from eating it (by having them learn tha tit was toxic to eat). The mushrooms that weren't toxic got eatena nd wouldn't be able to produce spores. The surviving toxic mushrooms could produce spores, and these new mushrooms all carried the mutant gene/s for the toxic chemical.","The wild population did not have this toxic chemical. At some point, a random mutation occurred in the DNA which led to the production of this chemical. When mammals tried to eat these mutatn mushrooms the toxic chemical made them sick or killed them. The mammals learned ot not eat these toxic mutants, and this allowed the mutant mushrooms to increase their number within the wild population."12,The initial occurrence may have come from a mutation or gene flow or genetic drift. Making the species perform a different role. If the species wasn't able to survive with the toxin then the gene flow will change due to the environment.,"A mutation, a nonsense mutation that allowed the codon to become a stop codon that halted the production of the toxin."13,"Biologists would notice it being poisonous to all, and slowly overtime a population in which is around or uses these mushrooms within their genetic makeup will compensate for their poisonous inability to tolerate the mushrooms. Their  ? Will evolve  and undergo ","Biologists can explian the increase in frequency of individuals that no longer produce this toxin due to a mutation occurring in the plant causing to not be toxic,. Their lack of toxicity allows makes them more fit for their environment because they can get eaten by mammals and ? particles. Mushroom will become way more of ? and the more frequent member of the population."14,"Initially, there would be a mutation that would create a ""code"" to not produce the protein to make the toxin. The increase in frequency could b attributed to the possible benefit the mutation held and is reaction to survival and reproduction.",The initial occurrence of the mushroom no longer producgin the toxin is due to a random mutation that did not allow the mushroom to prduce the protein needed for the toxin. It's possible that this mutation provided a benefit to the population if the initial mushrooms was able to pass on genes so readily (spores).15,The mammals will no longer eat the mushrooms due to the toxic chemical. Because they are no longer eating them the mushrooms that don't produce the toxin will be free to reproduce. Due to the fact that the mammals think they are toxic.,"Animals that used to eat this  mushrooms stay away due to the toxic nature. Somewhere along the way one mushroom came about that didn't have the toxic chemical (random mutation). Because the animals think the mushroom is poisonous they stay away from it. This allows the mushroomm to reproduce and pass on its non-toxic genes, causing an increase in the number of non-toxic mushrooms."16,The initial occurrence would occur through some sort of mutation during DNA replication on the allele that produces the toxin. This mushroom without toxin would reproduce/replicate and pass on some allele that codes for no toxin to be made and this process of replication would continue and show an increase in frequency of this phenotype/characteristic of the mushrooms.,"Intially, the mushroom is tocis to mammals most likely by interrupting/disrupting protein function in the mammal that is essential to sustainging life. The initial occurrence of a mammals resistnt to mushroom toxicity would show that a mutation ahd accurred in teh mammals DNA sequence that codes for the protein affected by the mushroom. The mutation in the genetic code would change the structure of the protein so it was no longer affected by the mushroom. This way when the mammal east the mushroom the protein still works and mammal lives. Resistant mammal lives and passes on resistant genes to offpsring to increase frequency inpopulation while susceptable mammals die of musrhoom poisoning."17,One mammal would eat the toxic mushrooms an the others would soon realize over time that the species of muscrhoom is unsafte and therefore not consume it. The mammals would learn that there is a toxicty by experience with it but it would take some time for an entire population to not go near the mushrooms.,"The individuals that no longer produce the toxin could not produce it anymore due to the mammals building up a resistance to it. If the mammals are becoming resistant and no longer being affected by it, then the toxin may n ot help the longevity of the mushroom so they have stopped wasting energy produing it if it doesn't work."18,"It occurred because having the toxin deterred mammals form eathing them; allowing them to reproduce, but man at some point began killing things that they deemed harmful, so those mushrooms that had the toxin were selected against (removed) allowing the non-toxic ones ot continue to reproduce.","The initial occurrence came as a result of a mutation in the DNA that created a protein that is toxic to mammals. Overtime as mammals evolved they could have evolved a way to be resistant to the toxin or just learned not to eat the mushroom, either way to advantage to having the toxic would no longer exist for the mushroom so it was no longer selected for this would result in the increase in individuals in the population no longer produced the toxin."19,"The mushrooms with the toxic chemical is untouched and undesired by mammals, so they cannot grow as well. The ones without the toxin area given a propoer growing environment and can grow well. As a result, there would be an increase in the number of mushrooms not producing the toxin.","Mammals consume the mushrooms and if a toxin is present, they will be unappleaing and die out. Mushrooms without the toxin are consumed by the mammals so immediately it will be seen that the toxin-containing mushrooms are useless to the environment and die out. No longer producing the toxin helps the mushrooms get eaten."20,"Since this mushroom is toxic to mammals, over time mammals will stop eating this mushroom. Since there are no mammals eating this musrhoom the toxin is no longer essentioal for the survival of the species of mushroom, that could lead to an increase in the frequency and number of individuals without the toxin because it has not become advantageous to produce this toxin.  Allowing for energy ? used in the toxin to be used on other things.",Since the mushroom produced a toxin toxic to mammals it was favorable so that mammals would not eat it. An increase in a number and frequency of individuals without this ability could show that since it is no longer favorable to have this trait for survival a mutation may have occurred making the mushroom unable to produce the toxin. It has survived because the environment no longer rewords for the toxin trait more than the non-toxic trait.21,"Similar to above, some kind of mutation for the poison and those plants were not eaten so they were able to reproduce and pass thoses genes on to future generations. The population of poisonous mushrooms would soon outnumber non-poisonous ones since poisonous mushrooms are less likely to be eaten. Over time, animals would learn to stay away from teh mushroom simply be appearance, so the toxin would no longer be needed.",They could keep taking samples from that species of mushroom until a  negative one for the toxins appeared. Then check that area for more. They will most likely find more.22,Biologists would use LC50 test orlethal concentration test where it kills 50% of a population. The initial occurance would be the high rate of mortality. By regulating the dose amounts biologists can decifer the rate of resistance.,If there are fewer in number would mena they no longer produce the toxin as mammals are no longer deterred from eating them because they do not get poisoned.23,A number of non-toxic individuals must already exist in the population (or there must at least be gametes out there that don't produce the toxin). A selection pressure is present within the environment that causes non-toxicity to be a more advantageous trait among fungi. The toxic fungi are then diminshed in # and the non-toxic individuals proliferate and expand in number by monopolizing on the niche space opened by the absence of toxic fungi ,"Random mutation. The initial occurrence of a mutation that produces this toxin si completely random. Once that trait is established within the population and another mutation occurs for mushrooms without the toxin, perhaps relaxed pressure from consu;tion by mammals and a disadvangate to having hte toxin mutation could cause this increase."24,"There could have been a mutation that caused a mushroom to lose the chemical, and if not having the chemical doesn't mean harm for the plant it can survive and its offspring won't have the chemical and there will continue to be an increasein mushrooms without the chemical.","Biologist could say the mushrooms lost the evolution at some point, due to another mutation, or gene expression, but later regain it because they re-evolve it or the gene regulator turns it back on."25,"The musrhooms are going to become more prevalaent because they contain a toxic that is harmoful for mammals, so their population will increase, as less are being harmed by animals. There would be less individuals in the population that produce this toxin because they are not in contact/consuming this mushroom.","The number of individuals in the population no longer produced thei toxin because the mushroom had some change in its genetic code that couded for the preotin that did not make this chemical toxin. There must have been some biological fitness advantage to the musrhoom that did not produce this function, so over time it evolved. This would result in an incrase in frequency of the number of mushrooms that could not produce the toxin."26,One or a few individuals had a specific mutation that resulted in individuals that didn't procude the toxin. In some way this mutation was advantageous or increased repdocution in these individuals resulting in an increase in frequency of individuals that don't produce the toxin.,There was a random mutation in the population and the individuals with that mutation survived and reproduced. It cold be that the mutation was beneficial to the organism and that is why it survived or that it was lucky. It is over many generations that we begin to see a change in the whole population.27,"The increase in frequencyt is due to that mushrooms without the toxin are more genetically ""fit"" than the mushrooms that do. The mushrooms need the animals to eat them so they can spread their seeds and reproduce more, more offspring is higher fitness. The mutation to not produce the toxin is beneficial, so it is being selected by nature and thriving more than the unmutated mushrooms.",A mutation probably occurred making it so that it is no longer toxic to mammals. The increase in frequency of the non-toxic individuals probably comes from the benefits themushrooms are gaining from animals eating them. Because animals are eating them it is a way to spread their spores (from nontoxic plants0 which will make more non-toxic plants. The mushrooms probably no longer produce this toxin because themutation was benefical for the populations. Just like how the use of citrate in Dr. Lesnki's experiment was benficial and the population thrived.28,"Perhaps the toxin costs the organism a lot of energy to produce the toxin with not a significant number of musrhooms being eatne by mammals it would cause the musrhoom to be less fit as the energy expenditure coulnd't be sued for something more beneficial such as growth or reproduction. As all changes occur, the initial occurance would be explained as a random mutation.",In order for a plant ot produce a toxin it usually has to expend some energy. If nothing is selecting agains toxin free mushroom such as a mammal eating them the population is able to become toxin free. This begins with a random mutation in the population. If themusrhoom without toxin has higher fitness (is able to reproduce more) then the toxin free mushrooms can increase in number in the population.29,"A random mutation cause a non-toxic mushroom, but animals already associated the mushroom with dnager so they leave it be. This mushroom survivies long enough to reproduce. All of its offspring, or at least most of them, are also non-toxic. The non-toxic allele is dominant so the population slowly decreased in the number of mushrooms expressing the toxic allele. Therefore, the number of individuals in the population that no longer produce the toxin increases in frequency.",A random mutation had a mushroom that no longer produce the toxin. Perhaps not making toxin is more energy efficient. The offspring of this mushroom now have an evolutionary advantage (less energy expended) than toxic mushrooms. Most mammals in the area probably avoide themusrhooms because they are assumed toxic. This means that untoxic mushrooms have more energy to reproduce while also not being eaten and the population frequency increases.31,"Animals with the tendencies to eat the mushrooms die and the animals left don't have these tendencies, so the non-toxic mutation occurs in the population but isn't erradicated by being eaten, so the % of non-toxic mushrooms in the population grows.","If mammals ate these mushrooms the ywould get sick or die. Because of this, the mammals that don't eat the  mushrooms have higher fitness and their offspring will, genetically, also know to avoid these mushrooms. With fewer mammals eating the mushroom, the mushroom can survive equally as well with or without the toxin, so once the non-toxin mutation occurs, the non-toxin mushrooms survive and produce offspring that are non-toxin, increasing the number of non-toxic mushrooms in the population."32,Initially the mushrooms that no longer produce the toxin would come from a random genetic mutation. The increase in frequency would result from the environment selecting for the non-toxic mushrooms.,The initial occurrence of an individual who did not produce the toxin occurred through a mutation in the enidividuals genoms. The increasein the number of individuasl who had this trait occurred because the enviroenemnt selected for the trait. Individuals with the trait then survive to produce offspring with the trait.33,A biologist may explain by saying that mammals that the mushrooms chemical once harmed possibly developed a resistance to the toxin. This could have been a result of mutation. When the toxin no longer harmed the mammals the opulation of mushrooms could co-evolve in oder to code for the creation of a new chemical that is effective in becoming toxic to mammals.,"A population has the ability to no longer produce a harmful toxin. In the gene, the organism's code can change the protein created, or simply if the same gene is being expressed at all. If a repressor protein is blocking the transcription of that gene, a genetic mutation can occur that allows a different promoter to turn on that gene that doesn't have the repressor binding to it."34,"Biologists could explain this occurrence by saying that when one or a few mushrooms were growing one experienced a genetic mutation cuasing it to no longer produce this toxin. When themammals ate this mushroom they would normall die, but because it is no longer tocis they are able to full digest and then pass the mushroom particles (seeds?) back into the soil. When this ossurs the nontoxic mushrooms are able to grown and spawn more, increasing in the population.","Biologists would explain the initial occurrence of individuasl that no longer produce this toxin by saying that a random mutation occurred in at least one organisms's DNA. This mutation caused an increase in the organisms fitness which gave it an advantage when it reproduces and pserads it offspring. Becuase the offspring had a higher fitness they were able to outcompete the other organisms in the area, thus increasing their population and overall the number of individuals that no longer produce this toxin."36,"There would have to be a mutation somewre in the reproduction of one of the toxin mushrooms. Then, another type of animal, perahps a reptile like a turtle, would eat the mushrooms that are toxic to mammals, leaving only the non-toxic mushrooms to reproduce.",The initial occurrence would originate from a mutation eliminating this toxin from being produced. An explanation for why these non-toxic individuals are growing in frequency could be because the mammals that prey on the species are building resistance to the toxin or that some other type of animals (e.g. bird or reptile) preys specifically on the individuals that produce the toxin.37,"Biologist could say that a mutation in the DNA sequence of the individuals. Mutations can randomly occur chaging the genetic make-up of the animals/individulas. This small change may expant to produce a resistance/stoping of toxin production. If the individuals are stressed in this ""mushroom toxic"" environment only themutated ""toxic resistant"" individuals will survive and reproduce thus increasein the frequency of these individuals","The case is all based on mutations and selectivity. The toxin could naturally excit (wild type) but due to random mutation and environmental stress, such as mammals displeasure because its toxic. A capable mutation could have occurred within the genes of the musrhoom DNA not producing the toxin. Increase in genes (number of individuals) is directly related to selectivity thus if the mammals enjoy the non-toxic mushrooms more its population will increase. If the toxic mushroom was made to resist it getting eaten this would remove animals (don't want to eat musrhoom). If the animals left and sotp eating the mushroom overall less pressure would cause the original non-toxic mushroom to increase population."38,"The initial occurrence would be due to some random genetic mutation that changed the mushrooms phenotype from toxic to non-toxic. The increase in frequency would be due to the fact that, for some reason, individuals with the non-toxic phenotype were able to survive and reproduce at a level similar to or greater than individuals with the toxic phenotype.",The initial occurrence would be due to a random mutation in the gene that regulated production of the toxin. The increase of allele frequency in the population implies that there is some advantage (or at least a loss of disadvantage) for the musrhooms that are not toxic - they are able to grow and reproduce.39,Sometimes if a certain allele or trait is not being used it can be turned off. If the mammals knew of the toxicity of the mushroom it would not be consumed. After much time the mushrooms could lose their toxicity and still keep their existence. If there are not predators there is not always a reason for certain protection.,"If a mushroom is toxic and mammals eat it then they would die. If an animal dies then the other animals could learn not to eat the plant. When the mushrooms have not been eaten for a while then their defense system doesn't need to be as high as it used ot be. When their defense goes down they can actually stop making the toxin, becoming unpoisonous."
